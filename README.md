# Heavy-Rubber-Wallet
Wallet to store Mobile and some stuff made from heavy rubber

This project is a wallet for some useful stuff to carry around. I always want to carry my mobile, car keys and some money with me while on parties. Unfortunately my garments do not have enough space for this. So I designed this wonderful wallet made from 2mm and 4mm heavy industrial rubber. In the BOM list you can find all needed items to draft one by yourself as well as the shopping sources I bought my stuff at. 

I used a drafting program called Valentina (https://valentinaproject.bitbucket.io) which I find it worked quite nicely designing this sort of stuff. You are able to just open the project in Valentina and alter it if you want. 

In the pictures directory I provide some pictures of the finished work. 

If you have any problems and/or request, feel free to drop me an email at latexdoc@gmx.de.

Finally have fun!

Cheers,
Doc
